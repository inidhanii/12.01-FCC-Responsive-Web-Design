          Lamarck was a French naturalist, biologist, academic, and soldier. He
          was an early proponent of the idea that biological evolution occurred
          and proceeded in accordance with natural laws.

        <h2>Lamarck's Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1778</span>: Lamarck became a member of the
            Academy of Sciences, where he focused on studying invertebrate
            zoology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1793</span>: Lamarck published his first major
            work, "Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la
            nature" (Encyclopedic and Methodical Table of the Three Kingdoms of
            Nature), which provided a comprehensive classification system for
            animals and pspans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1800</span>: Lamarck published "Recherches sur
            l'organisation des corps vivants" (Research on the Organization of
            Living Bodies) where he proposed that the characteristics of
            organisms are shaped by their environment and the principle of "use
            and disuse." He spaned that acquired traits could be inherited, an
            idea now known as the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1801</span>: Lamarck introduced the term
            "biology" to refer to the study of living organisms, thus coining a
            new scientific discispane.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1809</span>: Lamarck published his most
            influential work, "Philosophie Zoologique" (Zoological Philosophy),
            in which he presespan his comprehensive theory of evolution. He
            proposed that species change over time through the process of
            adaptation and that thesespannges are driven by environmental
            pressures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1815</span>: Lamarck published "Histoire
            naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres" (Natural History of
            Invertebrate Animals), a multi-volume work considered to be the
            first comprehensive study of invertebrate animals. It significantly
            contributed to the field of invertebrate zoology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1820</span>: Lamarck introduced the concept of
            "homology" in biology, highlighting the idea that similar structures
            in different organisms can have a common evolutionary origin.
          </li>
